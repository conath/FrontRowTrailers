So, the first prehistoric family sets off into the world in search of a safer place to call home. When they discover an idyllic walled-in paradise that meets all their needs, they think their problems are solved … except for one thing. Another family already lives there: the Bettermans.    The Bettermans (emphasis on the “better”)—with their elaborate tree house, amazing inventions and irrigated acres of fresh produce—are a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder. When they take the Croods in as the world’s first houseguests, it isn’t long before tensions escalate between the cave family and the modern family.    Just when all seems lost, a new threat will propel both families on an epic adventure outside the safety of the wall, one that will force them to embrace their differences, draw strength from each other and forge a future together. </description></info><cast><name>Nicolas Cage</name><name>Emma Stone</name><name>Ryan Reynolds</name><name>Catherine Keener</name><name>Cloris Leachman</name><name>Clark Duke</name><name>Leslie Mann</name><name>Peter Dinklage</name><name>Kelly Marie Tran</name></cast><genre><name>Family</name><name>Fantasy</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="177510400">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/croods-2-trailer-2_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="27404"><info><title>The Forever Purge</title><runtime>2:26</runtime><rating>R</rating><studio>Universal Pictures</studio><postdate>2021-05-12</postdate><releasedate>2021-07-02</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2021 Universal Pictures</copyright><director>Everardo Gout</director><description>All the rules are broken as a sect of lawless marauders decides that the annual Purge does not stop at daybreak and instead should never end.

Now, for the first time, their amazing untold true story comes to the big screen in the family film event of the year – WITNESSES. Featuring a world-class cast, WITNESSES has been hailed as the most significant and ambitious film dealing with the early history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the translation of the Book of Mormon ever made. Directed by Mark Goodman, the film explores how Harris, Cowdery and Whitmer became known as the Three Witnesses and how, to their dying days, they defended their testimonies even when faced with threatening mobs, ridicule, and betrayal by friends and family.</description></info><cast><name>Michael Zuccola</name><name>Caleb J.
