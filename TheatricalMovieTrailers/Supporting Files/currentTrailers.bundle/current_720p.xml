Knowing Anna needs to be abruptly shaken and stirred from her deep funk, her best friend Charleen (Dulcé Sloan) takes Anna to an all women underground fight club. It’s here that Anna encounters an eclectic cast of characters, including the intimidatingly perfect and most brutally efficient fighter of the club, Olivia (Bella Thorne), who quickly becomes a rival in and out of the ring.

When underdog Cassius Clay, soon to be called Muhammad Ali, (Eli Goree), defeats heavy weight champion Sonny Liston at the Miami Convention Hall, Clay memorialized the event with three of his friends: Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) and Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge). Based on the award-winning play of the same name, and directed by Regina King, One Night In Miami… is a fictional account inspired by the historic night these four formidable figures spent together. It looks at the struggles these men faced and the vital role they each played in the civil rights movement and cultural upheaval of the 1960s. More than 40 years later, their conversations on racial injustice, religion, and personal responsibility still resonate.</description></info><cast><name>Kingsley Ben-Adir</name><name>Eli Goree</name><name>Aldis Hodge</name><name>Leslie Odom Jr.</name><name>Joaquina Kalukango</name><name>Nicolette Robinson</name><name>Beau Bridges</name><name>Lance Reddick</name></cast><genre><name>Drama</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/one-night-in-miami/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/independent/one-night-in-miami/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="77307729">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/independent/one-night-in-miami/one-night-in-miami-trailer-1_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="21547"><info><title>Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway</title><runtime>2:29</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>Sony Pictures</studio><postdate>2020-01-16</postdate><releasedate>2021-01-15</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2021 Sony Pictures</copyright><director>Will Gluck</director><description>In PETER RABBIT 2: THE RUNAWAY, the lovable rogue is back.

According to Docter, the idea for the story is 23 years in the making. “It started with my son-hes 23 now-but the instant he was born, he already had a personality,” says Docter. “Where did that come from? I thought your personality developed through your interaction with the world. And yet, it was pretty clear that we’re all born with a very unique, specific sense of who we are”. </description></info><cast><name>Jamie Foxx</name><name>Tina Fey</name><name>Phylicia Rashad</name><name>Ahmir Questlove Thompson</name><name>Daveed Diggs</name></cast><genre><name>Family</name><name>Musical</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/disney/soul/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/disney/soul/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="129632386">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/pixar/soul/soul-trailer-3_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="25083"><info><title>Stars Fell On Alabama</title><runtime>1:42</runtime><rating>PG-13</rating><studio>Samuel Goldwyn Films</studio><postdate>2020-11-23</postdate><releasedate/><copyright>© Copyright 1969 Samuel Goldwyn Films</copyright><director>VW Scheich</director><description>Successful Hollywood agent Bryce Dixon is returning to Alabama for the first time in 15 years for his high school reunion.

So, the first prehistoric family sets off into the world in search of a safer place to call home. When they discover an idyllic walled-in paradise that meets all their needs, they think their problems are solved … except for one thing. Another family already lives there: the Bettermans.    The Bettermans (emphasis on the “better”)—with their elaborate tree house, amazing inventions and irrigated acres of fresh produce—are a couple of steps above the Croods on the evolutionary ladder. When they take the Croods in as the world’s first houseguests, it isn’t long before tensions escalate between the cave family and the modern family.    Just when all seems lost, a new threat will propel both families on an epic adventure outside the safety of the wall, one that will force them to embrace their differences, draw strength from each other and forge a future together. </description></info><cast><name>Nicolas Cage</name><name>Emma Stone</name><name>Ryan Reynolds</name><name>Catherine Keener</name><name>Cloris Leachman</name><name>Clark Duke</name><name>Leslie Mann</name><name>Peter Dinklage</name><name>Kelly Marie Tran</name></cast><genre><name>Family</name><name>Fantasy</name><name>Action and Adventure</name></genre><poster><location>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/images/poster.jpg</location><xlarge>http://trailers.apple.com/trailers/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/images/poster-xlarge.jpg</xlarge></poster><preview><large filesize="177510400">https://trailers.apple.com/movies/dreamworks/the-croods-a-new-age/croods-2-trailer-2_a720p.m4v</large></preview></movieinfo><movieinfo id="24661"><info><title>The Empty Man</title><runtime>1:36</runtime><rating>Not yet rated</rating><studio>20th Century Fox</studio><postdate>2020-10-20</postdate><releasedate>2020-10-23</releasedate><copyright>© Copyright 2020 20th Century Fox</copyright><director>David Prior</director><description>After a group of teens from a small Midwestern town begin to mysteriously disappear, the locals believe it is the work of an urban legend known as The Empty Man.
