# Front Row Trailers Privacy Policy

This website does not collect any data.

Front Row Trailers (the app) downloads movie information and trailers from iTunes Trailers. In this process no cookies or other tracking technology is used, meaning your trailer watching habits are not recorded by the backend.

The app collects no personally identifiable information. It collects statistical data about how often users use certain features, and which trailers users watch. These data never include any personally identifiable information, and can't be linked to you. In other words, we can see how many times a certain trailer was watched but now who watched it. The same goes for all other features in the app.

Front Row Trailers is built on technologies provided by Apple Inc. See the [Apple Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/en-ww/) and [Apple Platform Security](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/welcome/web) website for more information.
